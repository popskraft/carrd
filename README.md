# Carrd Companion Plugins

A small collection of Carrd companions: each plugin ships as minified CSS/JS under `dist/<plugin>/**` (for example `dist/grid-cluster/**`), while shared themes live inside `dist/themes/<theme>/**`. Everything is published to jsDelivr so you can embed the files without hosting them yourself.

| Plugin | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Grid Cluster** | Merge consecutive Carrd containers into one responsive grid (2–6 columns) by giving each block a `grid-*` class. Keeps layouts consistent across breakpoints without manual wrappers. |
| **No Load Waiting** | Forces Carrd to play animations as soon as the DOM is ready. Removes the default loader, toggles the `is-ready` state, and fires scroll/resize events so visitors see the page animate immediately. |

Every plugin folder includes an `example.html` snippet plus a generated README with copy-ready instructions.

## Quick Start (All Plugins)
You can follow either approach below—the plugin README under `dist/<plugin>/README.md` repeats the steps with the correct CDN links.

### Option 1 — Use `example.html`
1. Download `dist/<plugin>/example.html` or open it directly on GitHub.
2. In Carrd, add an **Embed → Code** element.
3. Set **Style** → *Hidden → Body End* and paste the entire contents of `example.html`.
4. Publish. The snippet injects both the CSS and JS from jsDelivr in one go.

### Option 2 — Manual CDN Embeds
Add two separate embeds so you control where CSS and JS load:

**CSS (Head)**  
1. Embed → Code → *Hidden → Head*  
2. Paste the stylesheet tag, replacing the path with the plugin you need:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/popskraft/carrd@main/dist/grid-cluster/style.css">
   ```

**JavaScript (Body End)**  
1. Embed → Code → *Hidden → Body End*  
2. Paste the script tag with the matching plugin path:
   ```html
   <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/popskraft/carrd@main/dist/no-loadwaiting/script.js"></script>
   ```

The latest commit on `main` is always live on jsDelivr, so you don’t have to host anything yourself.

## Repository Layout
- `src/<plugin>/` – human-readable sources (CSS, JS, README) for each plugin.
- `src/themes/<theme>/` – shared theme assets that plugins can optionally load.
- `dist/<plugin>/**` and `dist/themes/<theme>/**` – minified bundles generated by `scripts/minify_plugins.py`.

## Need Help?
- Check the plugin-specific README in `dist/<plugin>/...` for detailed usage notes.
- File an issue if you notice a bug or need a new Carrd automation.
**Internal guidance:** Development workflow and build instructions live in `.docs/developer-notes.md`.
