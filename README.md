# Carrd Grid Cluster 2

Public artifact for CDN. This repository contains only what Carrd loads from jsDelivr:

- `plugins/mini/grid-cluster/style.css`
- `plugins/mini/grid-cluster/script.js`

All source files, metadata, build scripts, and documentation are located in a private working repository and are not published here.

## CDN Usage
Include files via jsDelivr (updates after each release):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/popskraft/carrd@main/plugins/mini/grid-cluster/style.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/popskraft/carrd@main/plugins/mini/grid-cluster/script.js"></script>
```

To get a new build, run the build process in the working repository and copy the fresh files to `plugins/` in this public mirror.
